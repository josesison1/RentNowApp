68% of the requirements are covered by test cases which are 12 out of the 16 requirements have been tested for funtionality. Some of the requirements are still in progress and needs to be implemented. 

### What percent of test cases are currently passing?

Currently 62% of the test are passing.

### What level of Validation could be expected after Verification? (Acceptance Tests?) 

The validation of test that could be expected after verification is the login process. Once the user enters their proper login information, that data would need to be verified and validated for them to access the application. Once the user is completely logged in, they should be able to have full access to the application as far as posting a listing and to see other users listing and be able to message them.
